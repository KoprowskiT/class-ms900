Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS is one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and serverless.

Common IaaS business scenarios:
- Lift-and-shift migration
- Test and development
- Storage, backup, and recovery
- Web apps
- High-performance computing

## Platform as a Service

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.

Common PaaS business scenarios:
- Development framework
- Analytics or business intelligence
- Additional services
